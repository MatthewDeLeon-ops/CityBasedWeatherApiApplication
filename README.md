# CityBasedWeatherApiApplication
Built in 10 hours a Weather Web App run locally. 
-Uses GeoLocation
#  - Uses the time zone based on geo coordinates
# - Custom background 
# - Current Weather Metrics [TEMP,Humidity,pressure,sunrise&sunset are accurate]
# - accuracy 95% using open weather api
# Daily tempuratures are not nearly accurate due to the free api plan in use not supporting daily forecast. My compromise was using the 3 hour Forecast for 5 days.
# - mobile friendly in portrait mode
