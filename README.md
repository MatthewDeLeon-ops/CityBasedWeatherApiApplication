Current Weather Metrics [TEMP,Humidity(+/-2%),pressure,sunrise&sunset are accurate] accuracy 95% using open weather api

Note: Daily temperatures for the week are relatively accurate (+- 1 to 3Â°). The temperatures day time reflect around noon time and around 9pm. This is due to the api plan selected and using the free tier. I checked the weekly Day/Night temperature's against the weather channel's hourly weather forecasts.
