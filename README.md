Current Weather Metrics [TEMP,Humidity(+/-2%),pressure,sunrise&sunset are accurate] accuracy 95% using open weather api
# Daily tempuratures for 5 days are not nearly accurate due to the onecall api not supporting daily forecast "Daily forecast: unavailable" with the free plan. Currently it updates every 8 hours.. It is a little hard to tell. The solution is to either use a paid subscription tier or do a hourly forecast for 2 days.
